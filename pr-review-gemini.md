Thanks for this PR! This is a great initiative to standardize the test execution environment using `uv` and provide convenient runner scripts for different platforms. The approach helps ensure consistent Python versions and dependency management for tests, which is very valuable.

Overall, the changes look good and are well-structured. I have a few suggestions and minor points to consider:

---

### `run_tests.bat`

*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** This batch script is clear, concise, and effectively delegates to `run_tests.py`.
*   **Argument Forwarding:** `%*` is correctly used to forward all arguments.
*   **Nitpick:** Consider adding a newline at the end of the file. This is a common convention and helps some tools and diff viewers.

### `run_tests.py`

This script is the core of the new test runner and is generally well-written.

*   **Docstrings & Comments:** Excellent use of docstrings and comments to explain the purpose and functionality.
*   **`uv` Installation & Usage:**
    *   The logic to check for `uv` and install it if missing is good.
    *   Using `uvx pip install -e .[test]` for dependencies and `uvx python -m pytest` for running tests is the correct way to leverage `uv` for environment and version management.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Good use of `try...except subprocess.CalledProcessError` and `FileNotFoundError`.
    *   Returning appropriate exit codes via `sys.exit()` is good practice.
*   **Argument Parsing:** `pytest_args = sys.argv[1:] or ["-v"]` is a nice touch for a default verbose output.
*   **Suggestion: Clarify `uv` vs `uvx` in comments/docs.**
    *   The script's docstring mentions "You only need to install uvx". Later it says "Check if uvx is installed" but then installs `uv` using `pip install uv`. While `uvx` is a command provided by the `uv` package, it might be slightly clearer to state "You only need Python; this script will handle `uv` (which provides `uvx`) installation if needed." or consistently refer to installing the `uv` package.
*   **Suggestion: Python version for the runner script itself.**
    *   The script comments mention "Ensures Python 3.12.2+ is used". This is true for the test *execution environment* managed by `uvx` (assuming `pyproject.toml` specifies this). However, `run_tests.py` itself could theoretically be run by an older Python version if the system's default `python` or `python3` is older. Its own requirements (`os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `shutil`) are fairly standard and likely compatible with older Python 3 versions. This is generally not an issue but worth being aware of. The critical part is that `uvx` correctly manages the Python version for `pytest`, which this script ensures.
*   **Nitpick:** Consider adding a newline at the end of the file.

```python
# run_tests.py
# Suggestion for docstring clarification (minor):
# Original:
# """
# [...]
# You only need to install uvx, and this script handles everything else.
# """
#
# Suggested change:
# """
# [...]
# You only need Python installed. This script handles the installation of uv 
# (which provides uvx) if it's not already present, along with all other test setup.
# """

# Suggestion for comment clarification (minor):
# Original:
# if not check_uvx():
#     print("uvx not found. This is required to ensure the correct Python version.")
#     install_uvx()
#
# Suggested change (just to be super precise, current is mostly fine):
# if not check_uvx():
#     print("uv command (uvx) not found. This is required to ensure the correct Python version for tests.")
#     install_uvx() # install_uvx installs the 'uv' package
```

### `run_tests.sh`

*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** Clear and effective wrapper for `run_tests.py`.
*   **Executable Bit:** The `chmod +x "$0"` check is a thoughtful addition for usability.
*   **Argument Forwarding:** `"$@"` is correctly used to forward arguments, preserving spaces.
*   **Suggestion (Optional): Shellcheck recommendations.**
    *   For more robust shell scripts, consider adding `set -euo pipefail` at the beginning.
        *   `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
        *   `set -u`: Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
        *   `set -o pipefail`: The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status.
        For a simple script like this, it might be overkill, but it's a good habit for more complex scripts.
*   **Nitpick:** Consider adding a newline at the end of the file.

### `tests/integration/test_pipeline_execution.py`

*   **Mocking with `AsyncMock`:**
    *   The change from `agent_client.method.return_value = ...` to `agent_client.method = AsyncMock(return_value=...)` is a good improvement. Using `AsyncMock` is the standard and more robust way to mock `async def` methods. This ensures that the mock behaves correctly as an async callable and integrates well with `asyncio`.
*   **Unused Import:**
    *   `import time` is added but not used in the diff shown. Please remove it if it's not utilized elsewhere in the file.

```python
# tests/integration/test_pipeline_execution.py
# Remove unused import
-import time 
```

Great work on enhancing the testing infrastructure! These changes will make running tests more reliable and developer-friendly.

Please address the minor nits (newlines, unused import) and consider the suggestions for documentation/comment clarity.

Once that's done, I'm happy to approve!
